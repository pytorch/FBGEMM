FBGEMM_GPU (FBGEMM GPU kernel library) is a collection of
high-performance CUDA GPU operator library for GPU training and inference.

The library provides efficient table batched embedding bag,
data layout transformation, and quantization supports.


Currently tested with PyTorch 1.11 and CUDA 11.3
(previously tested with PyTorch 1.9 and automated CI testing planned)

Only Intel/AMD with AVX2 extensions are currently supported.

General build and install instructions are as follows:

Build dependencies: "pytorch", "scikit-build","cmake","ninja","jinja2","torch>0.9","cudatoolkit",
and for testing: "hypothesis".

```
# requires PyTorch 1.11 or later
conda install pytorch cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch-nightly
conda install scikit-build jinja2 ninja cmake hypothesis
```

**If you're planning to build from source** and **don't** have `nvml.h` in your system, you can install it via the command
below.
```
conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit-dev
```
 Certain operations require this library to be present. Be sure to provide the path to `libnvidia-ml.so` to
`--nvml_lib_path` if installing from source (e.g. `python setup.py install --nvml_lib_path path_to_libnvidia-ml.so`).


## PIP install

Currently only built with sm70/80 (V100/A100 GPU) wheel supports:

```
pip install fbgemm-gpu-nightly (nightly build version)
pip install fbgemm-gpu (release version)
pip install fbgemm-gpu-nightly-cpu (nightly build with CPU only)
pip install fbgemm-gpu-cpu (release version with CPU only)
```

## Build from source

Additional dependencies: currently cuDNN is required to be installed.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/pytorch/FBGEMM.git
cd FBGEMM/fbgemm_gpu
# if you are updating an existing checkout
git submodule sync
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Specify CUDA version to use
# (may not be needed with only a single version installed)
export CUDA_BIN_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-11.3/
export CUDACXX=/usr/local/cuda-11.3/bin/nvcc

# if using CUDA 10 or earliers set the location to the CUB installation directory
export CUB_DIR=${CUB_DIR}
# in fbgemm_gpu folder
# build for the CUDA architecture supported by current system (or all architectures if no CUDA device present)
python setup.py install
# or build it for specific CUDA architectures (see PyTorch documentation for usage of TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST)
python setup.py install -DTORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="7.0;8.0"
```


## Usage Example:
```bash
cd bench
python split_table_batched_embeddings_benchmark.py uvm
```
## Issues

Building is CMAKE based and keeps state across install runs.
Specifying the CUDA architectures in the command line once is enough.
However on failed builds (missing dependencies ..) this can cause problems
and using
```bash
python setup.py clean
```
to remove stale cached state can be helpfull.


## Examples

The tests (in test folder) and benchmarks (in bench folder) are some great
examples of using FBGEMM_GPU.

## Build Notes
FBGEMM_GPU uses a scikit-build CMAKE-based build flow.

### Dependencies
FBGEMM_GPU requires nvcc and a Nvidia GPU with
compute capability of 3.5+.

+ ###### CUB

CUB is now included with CUDA 11.1+ - the section below will still be needed for lower CUDA versions (once they are tested).

For the [CUB][1] build time dependency, if you are using conda, you can continue with
```
conda install -c bottler nvidiacub
```
Otherwise download the CUB library from https://github.com/NVIDIA/cub/releases and unpack it to a folder of your choice. Define the environment variable CUB_DIR before building and point it to the directory that contains CMakeLists.txt for CUB. For example on Linux/Mac,

```
curl -LO https://github.com/NVIDIA/cub/archive/1.10.0.tar.gz
tar xzf 1.10.0.tar.gz
export CUB_DIR=$PWD/cub-1.10.0
```

+ ###### PyTorch, Jinja2, scikit-build
[PyTorch][2], [Jinja2][3] and are scikit-build **required** to build and run the table
batched embedding bag operator. One thing to note is that the implementation
of this op relies on the version of PyTorch 1.9 or later.

```
conda install scikit-build jinja2 ninja cmake
```

## Running  FBGEMM_GPU

To run the tests or benchmarks after building FBGEMM_GPU (if tests or benchmarks
are built), use the following command:
```
# run the tests and benchmarks of table batched embedding bag op,
# data layout transform op, quantized ops, etc.
cd test
python split_table_batched_embeddings_test.py
python quantize_ops_test.py
python sparse_ops_test.py
python split_embedding_inference_converter_test.py
cd ../bench
python split_table_batched_embeddings_benchmark.py
```
