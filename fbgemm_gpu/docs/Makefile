# Makefile for Doxygen and Sphinx documentation generation

# There is an issue with Sphinx and the Breathe extension, where running the
# build with linting enabled causes the HTML pages to be rendered incorrectly
# (only Doxygen pages will show up), even when all linting passes and the build
# exits normally.  On the other hand, we would like to keep linting around to
# minimize documentation errors such as broken links.
#
# To solve this problem, we run two build passes as part of the documentation
# build.  The first build is run with lint options on, while the second one is
# run without.  This gives us the best of both worlds at the cost of doubling
# the documentation build time, which isn't too large.
#
# As such, The `SPHINX_LINT` environment variable is used to enable this
# toggling.
