///
/// It is for maintaining all the cache related operations, including
/// initialization, insertion, lookup and eviction.
/// It is stateful for eviction logic that caller has to specifically
/// fetch and reset eviction related states.
/// Cachelib related optimization will be captured inside this class
/// e.g. fetch and delayed markUseful to boost up get performance
///
/// @note that this class only handles single Cachelib read/update.
/// parallelism is done on the caller side
