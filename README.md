FBGEMM (Facebook GEneral Matrix Multiplication) is a low-precision,
high-performance matrix-matrix multiplications and convolution library for
server-side inference.

The library provides efficient low-precision general matrix multiplication for
small batch sizes and support for accuracy-loss minimizing techniques such as
row-wise quantization and outlier-aware quantization. FBGEMM also exploits
fusion opportunities in order to overcome the unique challenges of matrix
multiplication at lower precision with bandwidth-bound operations.

FBGEMM is used as a backend of PyTorch quantized operators for x86 machines:

See the full [Documentation](https://pytorch.org/FBGEMM) for more information
on building, installing, and developing with FBGEMM, as well as the most
up-to-date support matrix and API documentation for this library.
